# **App Name**: ParfumPal

## Core Features:

- Perfume Catalog: Display a curated collection of perfumes, leveraging data fetched from the Spring Boot backend based on categories.
- Detailed Product View: Show detailed information for each perfume, including name, brand, price, stock, description, and image URL fetched from the backend.
- User Authentication: Implement secure user login and registration functionality using your Spring Boot backend for authentication.
- Personalized Recommendations: Provide perfume recommendations based on user preferences. The LLM will use a user's purchasing history as a tool, combined with perfume characteristics from your database, to recommend similar perfumes to the user.
- Shopping Cart: Allow users to add perfumes to a shopping cart and adjust quantities.
- Order Summary: Present an order summary before checkout, showing selected items and total price.
- Secure Checkout: Implement a secure checkout process to simulate placing an order; for this MVP the order confirmation should only happen in the UI, but not process the order.
